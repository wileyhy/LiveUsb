find(1)
              If you use this option [ie, "-execdir"], you must ensure that your PATH environment variable does not
              reference `.'; otherwise, an attacker can run any commands they like by leaving an appropriately-named file in  a
              directory  in  which  you will run -execdir.  The same applies to having entries in PATH which are empty or which
              are not absolute directory names.
